# Jmix AI-Assisted Migration (Jmix 1 -> Jmix 2)

This repository is designed to facilitate migration of application projects from Jmix 1.x (Classic UI) to Jmix 2.x (Flow UI) with the help of AI agents.

Below we assume you are using Claude Code, but other agents should work as well.

## Key Differences: Jmix 1 vs Jmix 2

| Aspect             | Jmix 1.x                          | Jmix 2.x                            |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Vaadin**         | Vaadin 8 (Classic UI)             | Vaadin 24 (Flow UI)                 |
| **Persistence**    | `javax.persistence.*`             | `jakarta.persistence.*`             |
| **Validation**     | `javax.validation.*`              | `jakarta.validation.*`              |
| **UI Package**     | `io.jmix.ui.*`                    | `io.jmix.flowui.*`                  |
| **Screen Package** | `screen` folder                   | `view` folder                       |
| **Browse Screen**  | `StandardLookup`, `*Browse`       | `StandardListView`, `*ListView`     |
| **Edit Screen**    | `StandardEditor`, `*Edit`         | `StandardDetailView`, `*DetailView` |
| **Tables**         | `table`, `groupTable`             | `dataGrid`                          |
| **Filter**         | `filter`                          | `genericFilter`                     |
| **XML Root**       | `<window>`                        | `<view>`                            |
| **XML Schema**     | `http://jmix.io/schema/ui/window` | `http://jmix.io/schema/flowui/view` |

## Migration process

### Setup

- Create `workspace/jmix1-source` folder and copy or clone the source Jmix 1.x project into it, for example `jmix1-source/myapp`.
- Create project `workspace/jmix1-source/myapp-jmix2` using Jmix Studio 2.x, with the same base package as in source project.
- Init git repo and commit all.
- Setup IntelliJ IDEA MCP Server
	- Settings -> Tools -> MCP Server
		- Enable
		- Claude Code -> Auto-Configure
- Open both `myapp` and `myapp-jmix2` projects in IntelliJ to be accessible by MCP server.
- Open terminal in `workspace` and run Claude Code.
- `/mcp`, check that `jetbrains` is connected.

### Sequence

We recommend to proceed with migration in the following sequence: entities, fetch plans, business logic, fragments, screens. If the project is large, split each phase to the smaller steps, e.g. by packages.

### Example prompts

After starting the agent and before giving any migration commands, initialize it by the following prompt (replace `myapp` with your app folder name):

```
Your task is to migrate a project from Jmix 1.x to Jmix 2.x.
The source project is located in the `source-projects/myapp`. The target Jmix project is created in `target-projects/myapp-jmix2`.
Read `AGENTS.md` to understand the project structure, migration approach and rules.
```

**Migration prompts:**

```
Migrate all entities.
```

```
Migrate all shared fetch plans.
```

```
Migrate all business logic.
```

```
Migrate fragments if any.
```

```
Migrate all screens in `com.company.myapp.screen.sample` package.
```

```
Migrate all screens.
```

## Claude Code Skills

This project includes a set of Claude Code skills (slash commands) that streamline the migration workflow. Skills are located in `workspace/.claude/skills/` and can be invoked via `/skill-name` in Claude Code.

### `/init-migration [source-project-folder]`

**Starting point for any migration.** Analyzes the Jmix 1.x source project and produces a structured `PLAN.md`.

What it does:
- Scans `jmix1-source/` for source projects
- Collects statistics: entities, screens, services, security roles, fragments, add-ons
- If multiple modules found — asks which one to start with
- Checks if a corresponding target Jmix 2.x project exists in `jmix2-target/`
- If no target project — warns and asks to generate one via Jmix Studio
- Generates `PLAN.md` with a wave-by-wave migration roadmap

Example:
```
/init-migration myapp
```

### `/sequential-migration [source-folder] [target-folder]`

**Main workflow skill.** Runs a full migration wave by wave, from entities to security.

What it does:
- Follows the 6-wave migration strategy from `AGENTS.md`
- Reads the appropriate migration-rules documents before each wave
- Asks for confirmation before starting each wave
- Tracks progress in `PLAN.md`
- Suggests splitting large waves by package

Waves: Entities → Fetch Plans → Business Logic → Fragments → Screens → Security

Example:
```
/sequential-migration myapp myapp-jmix2
```

### `/migrate-entity [entity-name-or-path]`

**Targeted entity migration.** Migrates a single entity class or a package of entities.

What it does:
- `javax.persistence.*` → `jakarta.persistence.*`
- `java.util.Date` → `java.time.*` (with proper type selection)
- Removes `@Temporal` annotations
- Adds `@DependsOnProperties` to `@InstanceName` methods
- Validates the result via IntelliJ inspections

Example:
```
/migrate-entity Owner
/migrate-entity entity.owner
```

### `/migrate-view [screen-id-or-class-name]`

**Targeted screen-to-view migration.** Converts a Classic UI screen into a Flow UI view.

What it does:
- Migrates Java controller: annotations, base class, event handlers, injections
- Migrates XML descriptor: root element, components, actions, layout
- Renames files and packages (`screen/` → `view/`, `*Browse` → `*ListView`)
- Handles component mapping (table → dataGrid, groupBox → details, lookupField → entityComboBox, etc.)

Example:
```
/migrate-view petclinic_Owner.browse
/migrate-view OwnerBrowse
/migrate-view screen.owner
```

### `/migrate-security [role-class-name]`

**Security roles migration.** Converts security annotations and adds required permissions.

What it does:
- `@ScreenPolicy` → `@ViewPolicy`, updates screen IDs (`.browse` → `.list`, `.edit` → `.detail`)
- Creates `UiMinimalRole` with mandatory `ui.loginToUi` permission
- Migrates row-level roles (import changes only)
- Warns about database-stored roles that need SQL migration

Example:
```
/migrate-security VeterinarianRole
/migrate-security all
```

### `/validate-migration [wave-name-or-all]`

**Quality gate.** Verifies migration completeness and correctness.

What it does:
- Compares source vs target: lists missing entities, views, services, roles
- Checks for leftover `javax.*` imports and Classic UI patterns in target
- Audits all `// TODO: migration` comments
- Runs build validation via IntelliJ
- Generates a structured report with completion percentage

Example:
```
/validate-migration entities
/validate-migration all
```

### Recommended workflow

```
1.  /init-migration myapp            # Analyze and plan
2.  /sequential-migration myapp myapp-jmix2   # Start wave-by-wave migration
    # ...or use targeted skills for specific items:
    /migrate-entity Owner
    /migrate-view petclinic_Owner.browse
3.  /validate-migration all           # Check completeness
4.  /migrate-security all             # Migrate security last
5.  /validate-migration all           # Final check
```
